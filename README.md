PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project focuses on solving a real-world business problem using optimization techniques, particularly Linear Programming, with the help of Python libraries such as PuLP. The goal of the project is to identify the best possible solution from multiple feasible options while satisfying given constraints and maximizing or minimizing a specific objective.
In many business scenarios, organizations face challenges such as minimizing production cost, maximizing profit, optimizing resource allocation, scheduling tasks, and managing supply chains. These problems cannot be solved efficiently using simple calculations. Optimization models help in making data-driven and mathematically optimal decisions.
In this project, the business problem is first defined by identifying decision variables, constraints, and an objective function. The objective function represents what needs to be optimized, such as profit maximization or cost minimization. Constraints represent real-world limitations such as budget, labor, material availability, or time.
The model is then implemented using PuLP, a Python library specifically designed for linear programming problems. PuLP converts the mathematical formulation into a solvable computational model and finds the optimal solution using built-in solvers.
After solving the model, the results are analyzed and interpreted to understand how resources should be allocated for best performance. The project also explains insights gained from the solution and how it can help businesses improve efficiency and profitability.
This project demonstrates how optimization techniques are applied in industries such as manufacturing, logistics, finance, operations management, and supply chain management. It provides practical exposure to operations research concepts and their real-world applications.
Overall, this project helps interns understand how mathematical optimization supports strategic decision-making and prepares them for roles in data science, business analytics, and operations research.
